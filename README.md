Built using the MYOSA sensor kit platform with the AccelAndGyro, BarometricPressure, LightProximityAndGesture, and OLED libraries. TinyML inference powered by `eloquent_tinyml` and `tflm_esp32`.

## Overview

This project turns the MYOSA ESP32 kit into a standalone seismic and motion monitor. The device reads 3-axis acceleration and gyroscope data from the MPU6050, fuses them into roll and pitch angles using a Mahony AHRS filter, and feeds a rolling 200-sample window into a 1D-CNN TensorFlow Lite Micro model running entirely on the ESP32.

The model classifies incoming motion into one of four states in real time. A local SSD1306 OLED display provides standalone field feedback, while a browser-based dashboard connects over Web Serial or BLE for live oscilloscope plots, event recording, timeline replay, and CSV/JSON export.

**Key features:**

* On-device TinyML seismic classification with four severity classes
* Mahony filter orientation — roll, pitch, and calibrated gyro bias
* Multi-page SSD1306 OLED interface with gesture-swipe navigation
* Browser telemetry dashboard with live graphs, 3D orientation cube, and event replay
* FreeRTOS mutex-protected I2C bus for reliable multi-sensor operation
* Hybrid detection combining AI model output with rule-based motion score fallback

## Features (Detailed)

### **1. Four-Class Seismic Classification**

The on-device TinyML model classifies motion into four states:

| Class | Label | Description |
|------:|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `IDLE` | No significant motion detected |
| 1 | `TREMOR` | Small rapid vibrations or shaking |
| 2 | `LANDSLIDE` | Stronger movement, tilt, or instability |
| 3 | `SEISMIC` | High-intensity shock or earthquake-like event |

The model is a 1D-CNN stored as a C byte array in `seismic_model.h` and runs entirely on-chip using TensorFlow Lite Micro. It accepts a rolling window of 200 samples × 5 features (`roll, pitch, accX, accY, accZ`) = 1000 float inputs, updated every 10 ms.

### **2. Sensor Fusion with Mahony Filter**

Raw MPU6050 data is converted and fused at approximately 100 Hz:

```cpp
float ax_g = raw_ax / 16384.0f;  // ±2g range
float gx_deg = (raw_gx - gyroX_bias) / 131.0f;  // ±250°/s range
```

The Mahony filter produces stable roll and pitch estimates that are robust against gyro drift. Gyro bias is calibrated at boot from 500 still samples — the device must remain stationary for the first 5 seconds.

### **3. Multi-Page OLED Interface**

The SSD1306 display cycles through four pages, navigated by APDS9960 swipe gestures:

| Swipe | Action |
|-------|--------|
| LEFT / RIGHT | Switch OLED page |
| UP | Tare IMU to current orientation |
| DOWN | Pause / resume serial telemetry |

Pages include a boot splash, live AI dashboard (roll, pitch, class, confidence), roll/pitch oscilloscope, and a bubble-level calibration view. An emergency warning screen overrides all pages when class is `LANDSLIDE` or `SEISMIC` and confidence exceeds 85%.

### **4. Browser Telemetry Dashboard**

A single-file HTML dashboard (`index.html`) requires no installation and runs in Chrome or Edge.

It accepts data in three modes:

- **Simulation** — generates realistic idle and seismic event sequences for UI testing
- **Web Serial** — connects directly to the ESP32 at 115200 baud
- **BLE** — connects via the WASTP BLE service (`4fafc201-...` / `beb5483e-...`)

Dashboard capabilities include live oscilloscope traces, FFT spectrum, 3D orientation cube, AI classification panel with per-class confidence bars, event recording, timeline replay with event markers, and export to CSV or JSON.

### **5. FreeRTOS Multi-Task Architecture**

The IMU pipeline runs in a dedicated FreeRTOS task pinned to core 1, sampling at 100 Hz independently of the main loop. All four I2C devices (MPU6050, BMP180, APDS9960, SSD1306) share the same bus, protected by a binary semaphore mutex:

```cpp
extern SemaphoreHandle_t i2cMutex;
```

This prevents bus collisions and ensures stable readings across all sensors simultaneously.

## Usage Instructions

### Startup

1. Wire all MYOSA sensors to the ESP32 I2C bus.
2. Upload the firmware using Arduino IDE.
3. Open Serial Monitor at `115200` baud.
4. Keep the device completely still for gyro calibration (approximately 5 seconds).
5. Wait for the confirmation messages:

```plaintext
>>> Gyro calibration complete.
>>> IMU task started.
```

6. The OLED will display the boot splash, then automatically switch to the AI dashboard.

### Dashboard

1. Open `index.html` in Chrome or Edge.
2. Select the data source (Simulation, Serial Port, or BLE).
3. Click **Connect**.
4. Click **Record** to begin capturing events.
5. Use **Mark Event** to manually tag notable moments.
6. Open the **Replay** tab to review the recording.
7. Export data using **CSV** or **JSON**.

### Gesture Controls (OLED)

```plaintext
Swipe LEFT / RIGHT  →  Change OLED page
Swipe UP            →  Tare IMU (set current position as zero)
Swipe DOWN          →  Pause / resume serial output
```

## Contribution Notes

To improve model accuracy, retrain using data collected from this exact hardware at 100 Hz with features in the order `roll, pitch, accX, accY, accZ`, normalized using training-set mean and standard deviation. Export the normalization constants to firmware constants so inference input matches training input precisely.
